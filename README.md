ractive-window - jQueryUI Dialog-like windowing built on [ractive](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive)
================================================================

component
---------
This component assumes use of the [component](http://component.io/) web component system.

Example
-------
To try the example, open example/example.html in a reasonably up to date browser.
To build the example, you need a filesystem that easily supports symlinks (sorry Windows users). Just run ```component build``` in the example folder.
